		<h1>Two2 In The Campagna</h1>
		<h2>bsdsdy Robert Browning</h2>
		<p>
			I wonder do you feel to-day As I have felt since, hand in hand, We sat
			down on the grass, to stray In spirit better through the land, This morn
			of Rome and May?
		</p>
		<p>
			For me, I touched a thought, I know, Has tantalized me many times, (Like
			turns of thread the spiders throw Mocking across our path) for rhymes To
			catch at and let go.
		</p>
		<p>
			Help me to hold it! First it left The yellowing fennel, run to seed There,
			branching from the brickwork's cleft, Some old tomb's ruin: yonder weed
			Took up the floating wet,
		</p>
		<p>
			Where one small orange cup amassed Five beetles,--blind and green they
			grope Among the honey-meal: and last,
			<span>on the grassy slope I traced it.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			From Sounding like an Obe (Met een klank van hobo 1980) Transled by Tanis
			Guest.
